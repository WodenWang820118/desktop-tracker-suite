## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Bun (workspace package manager)
- Running backend server (nest-backend on port 5000)

### Development

1. **Start the backend server** (in another terminal):

   ```bash
   bun run dev-nest
   ```

2. **Start the Vue development server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev-vue
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`

### Available Scripts

- `nx serve vue-tracker` - Start development server
- `nx build vue-tracker` - Build for production
- `nx test vue-tracker` - Run unit tests
- `nx lint vue-tracker` - Lint the code

## API Integration

The application connects to a NestJS backend API running on `http://localhost:5000/tasks`. The proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts` forwards requests from `/tasks` to the backend server.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /tasks` - Fetch paginated tasks with optional search
- `POST /tasks/create` - Create a new task
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update a task
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task

## Key Components

### TasksComponent.vue

Main component that displays the task list with search, pagination, and real-time updates.

### TaskItem.vue

Individual task card with reminder indicator and delete functionality. Double-click to toggle reminder.

### TaskForm.vue

Form component for adding new tasks with validation.

### HeaderComponent.vue

Navigation header with routing and theme toggle.

## Composables

### useTheme

Manages light/dark theme switching with localStorage persistence.

### useConfirm

Provides confirmation dialogs for destructive actions like task deletion.

## Styling

The application uses a combination of:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility classes
- **PrimeVue themes** (Aura preset) for component styling
- **Dark mode** support via CSS classes

## Comparison with ng-tracker

This Vue application implements the same features as the Angular ng-tracker application:

- Identical UI/UX
- Same API integration
- Feature parity (CRUD operations, search, pagination, reminders)
- Similar project structure adapted for Vue best practices
